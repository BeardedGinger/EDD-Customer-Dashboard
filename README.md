EDD-Customer-Dashboard
======================

Adds a customer dashboard shortcode which allows customers to quickly update profile information and view purchase and download histories. Also integrates with EDD Front-End Submissions and EDD Wishlists

## Usage
Create a page to host the `[edd_customer_dashboard]` shortcode. Typically use "Customer Dashboard"

This will add a new navigation menu within the page content containing "Profile", "Downloads" and "Purchase History" nav items. These items are tied to views populated with the default Easy Digital Downloads shortcodes.

## Integrations
Requires Easy Digital Downloads.

Works with EDD Front-End Submissions as well as the EDD Wishlists plugins. 

If EDD FES is activated, a new nav item will be added for non-vendors that allows customers to register to become a vendor.

If EDD Wishlists is activated, a link to view, edit or create wishlists will be added to the customer navigation.
